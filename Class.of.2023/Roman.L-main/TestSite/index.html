<h1>ruemint's Rhythm Game Guide</h1>
</hr>
<p>I will give you advice on rhythm games (specifically VSRG's) and how to get better at them. This guide will improve on accuracy, stamina, and how to be consistent. Before we begin, this guide is for newer players so more advanced players will be familiar with the advice. Some terms will also be included in the guide, you can search these up as they are quite common. o!m will also be referenced quite a bit as well as 4 key as I don't play 7 key much. This guide was made for a school assignment.</P>
<h2>Below are some beginner tips:</h2>
<strong> - Find the right skin to use<br>- Test different scroll speeds<br>
- Try maximise monitor refresh rate<br>- Don't look at the notes</strong>
<h3>Intermediate tips</h3>
<p> At this stage you can comfortably do 4*, you can now start focusing on hand placement. There are two placements, hover and resting. Resting is usually how you normally do it, and is how a lot of people play although hovering could be more comfortable as it is easier to do jackhammers.</p>
<p> If your planning to climb up the ranks, it is reccomended to play 7k maps. Many 7k maps offer a lot of performance points and could get you quite high up the ranks. It is also easy to find PP maps as many players share the same plays, such as Triumph and Regret, Galaxy Collapse, Blue Zenith, and NANO DEATH. Abusing the pause button is a way to save stamina, although you will stunt your improvement. </p>
<p> Warming up before long maps is important. I recommend playing maps which are easier to put less strain on your hands when you start to the long maps. Remember to stay hydrated.</p>
<p> Playing long maps helps a lot with stamina, just remember not to pause. Dan courses are a great way to improve stamina as the include a variety of skill sets and usually last for 10 mins. Here is a link for some dan courses: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/danreform/home">Reform Dan</a>.</p>
<strong> What are Dan courses? "For people who don’t know, dan courses are basically tests used to determine where you stand in terms of skill in BMS, PMS, Go and other games." - Shoegazer</strong>
<p> Playing many maps are helpful as many patterns you come across will be repeated among different maps. This includes jumptrills, jackhammers, handstreams and minijacks.</p>
<p> Playing TETRIS actually makes you better at rhythm games for some reason. It's a common trait among rhythm game players.</p>
