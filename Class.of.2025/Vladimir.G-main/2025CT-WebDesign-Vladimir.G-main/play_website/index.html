        <h1>Italian food</h1>
        <p>The Italian peninsula is packed with diverse culinary cultures which produce different
            Italian
            dishes. For
            instance,
            Sicily produces seafood dishes while Tuscany is best known for its simple yet rustic specials.

            Other nationalities from different countries have also adopted the Italian food tradition and have even
            become a
            staple
            food on their tables. For example, Americans are very much in love with pizza and pasta which is a popular
            Italian dish.

            Additionally, Italian food culture uses distinct ingredients for all of their dishes such as tomato,
            eggplant,
            pasta,
            cured meats, and cheese. You must not forget about the sweet Italian desserts that will surely conclude your
            meal with a
            bang.

            Italian food culture has influenced a lot of countries already. It is known to captivate the taste buds of
            so
            many
            people from different cultures around the world. Thus, these people adopted what they liked about Italian
            food
            and added
            locally grown ingredients and incorporated them into their own traditional dishes, and made them their own.

            The most important aspect that you must know about the Italian food culture is that their authentic dishes
            are
            only made
            with a few ingredients. However, these ingredients are carefully chosen and if the ingredient is not the
            freshest it can
            be they will not buy it but substitute for better quality or not make the dish at all. Each ingredient must
            shine since
            there are only a few ingredients..</p>

        <h1>Dishes through out the day</h1>
        <p>Breakfast


            The most popular breakfast nationwide is usually sweet, with hot or cold milk or fruit juice accompanied by
            baked
            products such as biscuits or the classic croissant.

            The coffee predominates with the variants of cappuccino, latte or the famous espresso.

            Less frequent, but not unusual, can be the savoury breakfast often composed of focaccia or just some toasted
            homemade
            bread seasoned with extra virgin olive oil or with tomato or some sliced ​​cured meat.



            Lunch
            Traditionally, in the Italian culture, lunch is the most important meal of the day and is, if complete, made
            up
            of three
            or four courses:

            An appetizer, cold or hot, is the least abundant course, and is generally composed of croutons or
            bruschetta,
            salami and
            / or sausages, cheeses and / or dairy products or cooked and / or raw vegetables or preparations based on
            fish
            and / or
            seafood;

            the first course, usually a dish based on pasta or risotto, rice or polenta or legumes or a soup;

            the second dish, generally based on meat or fish or dairy products and / or sausages, accompanied by a side,
            often
            composed of raw and / or cooked vegetables; then some sweet and / or fruit to finish

            coffee: it is very frequent and traditional in Italy that a meal, and above all a lunch, is completed by an
            espresso,
            followed by the so-called ammazzacaffè, that consists in a glass of local liqueur, bitter (like a lucano or
            a
            montenegro) or sweet (for example limoncello or sambuca).

            Wine is inevitable on the Italian’s tables, especially during a main meal such as lunch.



            Dinner
            Unlike lunch, a typical and daily Italian dinner does not include the presence of a first course based on
            starchy foods
            (like pasta or polenta) or cereals (like rice), so the main course is generally made up of what during lunch
            would be
            equivalent to a second dish (therefore a preparation based on meat, fish or cooked and / or raw vegetables)
            or
            at most a
            (light) soup, including however the presence of bread.

            The classic scheme of a common Italian dinner consists in an appetizer and a second dish that serves as a
            main
            course
            (or as a first course, if viewed from the perspective of Italian lunch), followed by a side dish of cooked
            or
            raw
            vegetables. However, the presence of a single dish as dinner is not uncommon during dinner.
        <h2>How did the Italian cuisine be popularised outside of Europe</h2>
        <p>The mass migration of Italians to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries further
            popularized
            Italian cuisine. Italians brought with them Italian street food such as pizza and pasta, which also soon
            became
            hugely
            popular on the streets of the United States. Italians also brought with them bread recipes, such as focaccia
            and
            Chianina bread, and how to prepare them with thin slices of ham, peppers or cuts of chicken in the form of a
            sandwich,
            which later became popular as a submarine. The British also incorporated Italian ingredients into their
            diet,
            which
            included everything from pasta, black pepper and salads to pine nuts, lemon juice, pesto and olive oil - as
            well
            as
            pizza, of course! Indeed, if you take a trip to a British supermarket these days, don't be surprised to find
            a
            tin of
            minestrone or a jar of pesto next to the leek and potato soup, or a tiramisu next to the apple crumble.
            Meanwhile, both
            their red and white wines are a cut above and enjoy huge success, being exported throughout the world.
            Italy is a pretty diverse country and every region offers different fresh produce that makes it readily
            available throughout Italy. From fresh eggs to oil, vegetables, meat, fish, herbs, and cheeses, Italian food
            is
            all
            about
            the
            freshness of all the ingredients they put into their dishes.</p>

        <h1>Why is the cuisine so simple</h1>
        <p>Like what was mentioned earlier, Italian cuisines are more attentive to how fresh their ingredients are and
            not
            the
            recipe’s complexity. Typical Italian food only requires a few ingredients to create and this is what makes
            Italians
            amazing.

            They can do a lot of wonders with such little ingredients and no one will ever notice. This is how talented
            they
            are
            when it comes to crafting a dish. Cooking is considered a work of art or craft by most Italian and almost
            everyone in
            Italy knows how to cook.

            Simplicity in Italian cuisine goes a very long way. As long as the ingredients are freshly chosen and the
            tradition,
            intention, and love are present, you will surely create a marvelous Italian dish..</p>
        <h2>The history</h2>
        <p>The history of Italian cuisine is rooted from generation to generation for each Italian family. Italian
            people
            care so
            much about their family’s cooking history that recipes are being passed from one generation to the other by
            word
            of
            mouth. However, as the old get older and the young are not interested until later some have taken to
            documenting
            the
            recipes which is a plus to history and readily available to the world via the internet.

            It is then the responsibility of the new generation to preserve the traditional recipes and pass them on to
            the
            young
            ones. However, in the general view of the entire Italian food culture, everything started from the ancestors
            of
            Italy.

            The Romans, which are the greatest ancestors of Italy, adored food so much. Back in the day, Romans loved to
            feast on
            food, organizing banquet after banquet just to taste the wonders of the Italian dishes. This is also the
            best
            time to
            serve and introduce new dishes to the table for everyone to try and judge. Rifugioâ€™s Country Italian
            Cuisine
            has taken
            this theme and creates feasts based loosely on seasonal events of Italy like â€œThe Feast of the Seven
            Fishesâ€
            or
            â€œThe Feast of Saint Francis in honor of their ancestors.

            The Roman empire accepted the flavors of all the ingredients from the places they have conquered. They
            enjoyed
            how the
            spices from the Middle East have enhanced their classic Italian favorites. Romans also started to introduce
            cereals that
            they acquired from North Africa and served them on their Italian tables.

            If today Italian dishes are only made with fewer ingredients, at the time of the Roman Empire, all their
            recipes
            are
            nothing less than elaborate. From the sophisticated food preparation techniques to intricate choice of
            ingredients.

            This is the reality of the Italian food culture back in the days, especially if you are cooking for the rich
            and
            famous
            families in ancient Rome. You must ensure that what you put on their table is the best and nothing less.
            However,
            ordinary people still stick to food that suits their living status which is usually a three-ingredient
            recipe.

            Wine, olive oil, and cereals are the most common ingredients Romans used in their simple everyday meal which
            the
            current
            Italian people still use up to this date.

            When the Barbarians came into the picture, the Roman Empire along with its traditions had come to an end.
            Traditions
            from both cultures clash with each other which resulted in one culture influencing the other and vice versa
            especially
            when it came to food.

            Romans are known to possess sophistication while Barbarians are referred to as harsh-speaking and
            rugged-looking
            people.
            These newcomers introduced beer and butter to the Romans, while the Romans taught the Barbarians about wines
            and
            the use
            of olive oil.

            In Sicily on the other hand, during the middle ages, the region was colonized by Arabs which influenced
            their
            culture
            and introduced the use of spices and dried fruits to the region. This Arabic influence can still be found in
            the
            modern-day dishes from Sicily.

            Contrary to what everyone assumed, dried pasta does not originate in Italy. It was just brought to Italy by
            Arabs as
            they found it easier to transport and preserve, which is suitable for their long journeys at sea.

            Religion also had a huge impact on how people in Italy eat. When Christianity was introduced, it greatly
            impacts
            how
            people in Italy choose their ingredients. The history of Italian food is a long topic to talk about and
            there
            are so
            many things in and around it that need to be tackled to better cover the entire history of Italian food.</p>
